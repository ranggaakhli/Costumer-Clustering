# Costumer-Clustering
This notebook analyzes customer behavior with descriptive stats, univariate/multivariate analysis, Shapiro test, Chi-Square, and Cramér’s V. It applies PCA for dimensionality reduction, performs clustering with KMeans (Elbow, Silhouette) and Agglomerative (Dendrogram), and visualizes clusters in 2D/3D.
